# th0th-memory Skill

Mandatory rules for using th0th tools. Prioritize semantic search, compression, and memory over native tools (Glob, Grep, Read) to explore and understand code.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Searching for code patterns or implementations
- Understanding codebase architecture
- Storing important decisions or patterns
- Compressing large code contexts
- Retrieving memories from previous sessions
- Analyzing usage and performance metrics

## Available Tools

| Priority | Tool | Use |
|----------|------|-----|
| 1 | `th0th_index` | Index project before searching |
| 2 | `th0th_search` | Semantic + keyword search with filters |
| 3 | `th0th_optimized_context` | Search + compress in one call |
| 4 | `th0th_remember` | Store important information |
| 5 | `th0th_recall` | Retrieve memories from previous sessions |
| 6 | `th0th_compress` | Reduce context size (70-98%) |
| 7 | `th0th_analytics` | Usage patterns and metrics |
| 8 | Glob/Grep/Read | Only when th0th doesn't find |

## Tool Reference

### 1. th0th_index

Index a project directory for semantic search.

```
th0th_index({
  projectPath: "/home/user/my-project",
  projectId: "my-project",
  forceReindex: false,
  warmCache: true
})
```

### 2. th0th_search

Semantic + keyword search with RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion).

```
th0th_search({
  query: "JWT authentication middleware",
  maxResults: 10,
  minScore: 0.3,
  include: ["src/**/*.ts"],
  exclude: ["**/*.test.*"]
})
```

### 3. th0th_optimized_context

Search + compress in one call. Maximum token efficiency.

**Always pass `sessionId`** to activate the session file cache. On repeated calls within the same conversation, unchanged file chunks are replaced with a compact reference token (~8 tokens) instead of full content, saving 50-70% of input tokens in long sessions.

```
th0th_optimized_context({
  query: "how does authentication work?",
  projectId: "my-project",
  sessionId: "<use a stable identifier for the current conversation>",
  maxTokens: 4000,
  maxResults: 5
})
```

The response includes `metadata.tokensSavedBySessionCache` and `data.sessionCacheHits` so you can observe the savings. Call `invalidateSession` (via the API) if the user explicitly asks for a fresh read of all files.

### 4. th0th_remember

Store important information in persistent memory.

```
th0th_remember({
  content: "Using PostgreSQL for user data",
  type: "decision",
  importance: 0.8,
  tags: ["database", "architecture"]
})
```

### 5. th0th_recall

Search stored memories from previous sessions.

```
th0th_recall({
  query: "database decisions",
  types: ["decision"],
  limit: 10,
  minImportance: 0.3
})
```

### 6. th0th_compress

Compress context (keeps structure, removes details).

```
th0th_compress({
  content: "...large code...",
  strategy: "code_structure",
  targetRatio: 0.7
})
```

### 7. th0th_analytics

Usage patterns, cache performance, metrics.

```
th0th_analytics({
  type: "summary",
  limit: 10
})
```

## Compression Strategies

| Strategy | Use Case | Reduction |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| `code_structure` | Source code | 70-90% |
| `conversation_summary` | Chat history | 80-95% |
| `semantic_dedup` | Repetitive content | 50-70% |
| `hierarchical` | Structured docs | 60-80% |

## Memory Types

| Type | Use |
|------|-----|
| `preference` | User preferences |
| `conversation` | Important conversation points |
| `code` | Code patterns discovered |
| `decision` | Architecture decisions |
| `pattern` | Recurring patterns |

## Decision Flow

```
Need to find code?
  → th0th_search (first)
  → Glob/Grep/Read (fallback)

Need to understand architecture?
  → th0th_recall (check memories first)
  → th0th_search (explore code)

Found important pattern/decision?
  → th0th_remember (store for future)

Context too large?
  → th0th_compress (reduce tokens)

Maximum efficiency needed?
  → th0th_optimized_context (search + compress)
```
